# Boyi

A systematic framework for automatically deciding the right execution model for OpenCL applications on FPGAs (FPGA'20)

## Overview
This repository contains:
- PART ONE: 11 OpenCL applications on FPGAs
    - Source code of all the optimization combinations under four execution models
    - Detailed resource consumption and absolute performance numbers of our experiments
- PART TWO: an LLVM-based automatic tool to determine whether to use two emerging OpenCL features

This work explores the optimization combinations on FPGAs for four high-level execution models: NDRange kernel (*NDR*), Single work-item kernel (*SWI*), NDRange kernel+OpenCL channel (*NDR+C*), Single work-item kernel+OpenCL channel (*SWI+C*). 

And our goal is to assist OpenCL programmers to determine the most suitable execution model based on the presence or absence of three OpenCL patterns: Atomic Operation (*AO*), Multi-Pass Scheme (MPS) and Kernel-to-Kernel Communication (KKC).


The 11 OpenCL applications include:

### Usage

(Take CEDD application as an example:)

We'd recommend you to compile and run the project in `CEDD_test\`, which implements `baseline.cl` in `NDRange\`, through the following steps. After running successfully, you can replace the related code with other code in `NDRange\`, or `SWI\`, or `NDRange+Channel\` or `SWI+Channel\` to try whatever implementations you interested.

**NOTE**: please make sure to build the OpenCL+FPGA environment before.
1. See [Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL Pro Edition: Getting Started Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/documentation/mwh1391807309901.html#mwh1391807297091 "Title") for details of installing Intel OpenCL SDK. 
2. Refer to vendor's manual for detailed steps of installing FPGA board and driver. The step of installation can be different for different FPGA board and operating system. For Terasic DE5a-Net board, please refer to [DE5a-Net OpenCL Manual](http://download.terasic.com/downloads/cd-rom/de5a-net/linux_BSP/I2/DE5ANET_I2_OpenCL_16.1.pdf "Title")


#### Compiling the OpenCL Kernel
To compile the OpenCL kernel, run:
```
aoc device\baseline.cl -o bin\baseline.aocx --board <i>\<board></i>
```

where <i>\<board></i> matches the board you want to target. If you are unsure of the boards available, use the following command to list available boards:
```
aoc --list-boards
```

#### Compiling the Host Program
To compile the host program, build the project in Visual Studio 2010 (or later). The compiled host program will be located at `bin\host`.

#### Running the Host Program
Before running the host program, you should have compiled the OpenCL kernel and the host program. To launch the host program, use <i>Ctrl + F5</i> or the following command:
```
bin\host
```



## PART TWO: LLVM based automatic tool


### Software & Hardware Requirement

In our work, Clang 9.0.0 and LLVM9.0.0 are first installed in Ubuntu 14.04. Please see [Getting Started with the LLVM System - Requirements](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#requirements "Title") to find detailed software and hardware requirements.


### Packet Structure

- The `apps` folder contains the OpenCL kernel code and the host C/C++ code of the 11 OpenCL applications.
- The `Transforms` folder mainly contains the LLVM passes for IR analyzation.
- The `run.sh` file is the shell script.

### Usage

Please refer to LLVM's documentations for details of configuring and compiling LLVM. An LLVM getting started guideline can be found [here](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html "Title"). Or you can start to use our LLVM tool (in a Linux environment) quickly following the steps below:

If you have already finished configuring the LLVM environment, please start with Step 3.

#### Step 1: Checking out the LLVM project
```
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
```

#### Step 2:  Building LLVM and Clang
```
cd llvm-project
mkdir build
cmake -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang -G "Unix Makefiles" ../llvm
make
make install
```
Then you can try it out:
```
clang --version
```
You may get:
```
clang version 9.0.0 (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git 75afc0105c089171f9d85d59038617fb222c38cd)
Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /usr/local/bin
```

#### Step 3: Using Boyi
- Move the ```apps``` folder and the ```run.sh``` file to the same directory as the ```llvm-project``` folder.
- Add all the folders in the ```analysis_passes``` folder to the ```llvm-project/llvm/lib/Transforms``` folder.
- Copy the following lines into ```llvm-project/llvm/lib/Transforms/CMakeLists.txt```:
  ```
  add_subdirectory(HasAO)
  add_subdirectory(NumOfKernels)
  add_subdirectory(IsSameBuff)
  add_subdirectory(IsRdWr)
  add_subdirectory(IsSameMAP)
  add_subdirectory(IsSequential)
  add_subdirectory(VarBuffInHost)
  add_subdirectory(VarBuffInKernel)
  add_subdirectory(Model)
  ```
- Change directory to llvm-project/.. and run:
  ```
  cd llvm-project/..
  /run.sh
  ```
